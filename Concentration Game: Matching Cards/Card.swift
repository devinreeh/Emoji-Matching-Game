// In swift, structs are very similar to classes except
// 1.) structs have no inheritance (makes it simpler)
// 2.) structs are value types, classes are reference types
// value type, when you pass it as an argument or assign it to another variable it gets copied
// ** arrays, ints, strings, and dictionaries are structs **
// ** it's not inefficient because Swift only makes a copy when someone
//    modifies it ( called copy on write semantics )**
//
// ** reference type, the thing lives in the heap, you've got pointers to it, when you pass it around
//    you're just passing pointers to it **

    // doesn't need the emoji because this is a part of the model and the model is UI independent
    // this Card struct just defines the behavior of the Card not what is being displayed on the card
    
    // static means that even though this method is in Card
    // you can't send it to a card ( a card doesn't understand it )
    // but the type card understand this message ** global function utility function tied to the type **
